        <h1>How can I enable night mode and customize my profile?</h1>
        <p>
            You can use your <a href="/account/manage">account management page</a> to enable night-mode, add a profile photo or avatar, write a short bio and further personalize your account.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I submit links to sites I operate?</h1>
        <p>
            Submitting only links to sites you operate (or are associated with), without submitting other, unrelated links, is considered spamming. If you submit niche content (for example gaming videos from your own YouTube channel), you should create your own subverse and submit the content only to that subverse.
            If majority of the links you submit are to sites you are associated with, your domains may be globally banned from Voat. To be on the safe side, if you submit 10 links to various subverses on Voat, at most 2 of the 10 submitted links may be to the sites you are associated with.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I submit links to any subverse I want?</h1>
        <p>
            Each subverse has its own rules which are stated in respective subverse sidebars. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I register subverses and not use them?</h1>
        <p>
            We have multiple automated mechanisms in place which purge unused subverses. As soon as you register your subverse, you should submit at least one post and edit the sidebar.
            If you abandon your subverse, you may loose it if someone else requests to take it over.
        </p>
        <h1>Will you censor comments and submissions?</h1>
        <p>
            While we don't necessarily aprove or agree with all content that users submit to Voat, our policy is to not meddle and not censor content unless said content is illegal in Switzerland.
        </p>
        <h1>I forgot my password. Can you reset it for me?</h1>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to help you reset your password unless you added an e-mail address in your account preferences.
        </p>
        <h1>I wanted to register a subverse, but it is already registered and it looks abandoned. Can I take it over?</h1>
        <p>
            In most cases, yes. You can request to "adopt a subverse" by submitting a post to <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>I am a developer, how can I contribute to Voat?</h1>
        <p>
            You can join us on <a href="/v/voatdev">/v/voatdev</a> and you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/whoaverse/whoaverse/issues">open issues</a> on GitHub.
            We are always on the lookout for dedicated developers and if we like your contributions, we may offer you equity and a position at Voat.
        </p>
        <h1>I have more questions, where can I ask them?</h1>
        <p>
            You can submit your question to <a href="/v/help">/v/help</a>.
        </p>
